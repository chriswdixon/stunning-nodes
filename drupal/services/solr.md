# Solr

## Standard use
We provide you with the default schema files provided by [search_api_solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) version 8.x-1.2. This works for Solr 5.5 and 6.6

Specify the Solr version you would like to use in your docker-compose.yml file, following [our example](https://github.com/amazeeio/drupal-example/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L103-L111).

## Custom schema
If you use a different version of the search_api_solr module, you may need to add your own custom schema. The module allows you to download an easy config.zip file containing what you need.

Also if for any other reason you would like to implement schema customizations for Solr in your project, look to how Lagoon [creates our standard images](https://github.com/amazeeio/lagoon/blob/master/images/solr-drupal/Dockerfile).

* In the `solr` section of your docker-compose file replace `image: amazeeio/solr:6.6` with:

```
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: solr.dockerfile
```

*  Place your schema files in your code repository, we typically like to use `.lagoon/solr`
*  Create a solr.dockerfile

```
FROM amazeeio/solr:6.6

COPY .lagoon/solr /solr-conf/conf

RUN precreate-core drupal /solr-conf

CMD ["solr-foreground"]
```

The goal is to have your solr configuration files exist at `/solr-conf/conf` in the image you are building.

## Multiple cores

To implement multiple cores, you will also need to ship your own solr schema as above, the only change needed is to the `CMD` of the Dockerfile, repeat the pattern of `precreate-core corename /solr-conf/ ;` for each core you require.

```

FROM amazeeio/solr:6.6-drupal

RUN precreate-core drupal-index1 /solr-conf && \
    precreate-core drupal-index2 /solr-conf && \
    precreate-core drupal-index3 /solr-conf

CMD ["solr-foreground"]

```
